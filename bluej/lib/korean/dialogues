Please mail the text of the error message

editor-crashed
It seems that BlueJ crashed while writing this class
to disk last time. The source code may be missing or 
incomplete. There should be a backup of this class 
in the project folder. If this class seems damaged,
   1 - quit BlueJ
   2 - backup your project folder (just in case)
   3 - look into the project folder for a backup of
       this java file. Rename it to the original
       file name (with a '.java' suffix)

open-non-bluej-invalid
You have indicated you wish to open this
directory as a BlueJ project, however a file
has been found with a package statement that
is incompatible with the current directory
structure. (For example, if the Java class
Shape has a package line of com.aa, then the
file Shape.java must be in a directory aa
which is itself in a directory com. This com
directory in turn must be in another directory
which is the directory you should point BlueJ
to when attempting to open it).

to a package which does not exist in this project.
If you wish to move this class to another
package you must create the destination

reverted back to its original form.

package-name-changed
You have changed the package statement which
tells Java the package this class is in. Do you
want to move this class to the indicated package
