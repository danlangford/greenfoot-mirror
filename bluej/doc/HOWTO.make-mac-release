Building Mac OS X release bundles
---------------------------------

There are two bundles generated for Mac OS X: The regular bundle which includes
a JDK, and the "legacy" bundle which uses the system JDK (JDK 6).

1. Follow instructions in HOWTO.make-release, up to the point where you have
   run the "ant dist" target. Your build.properties file must specify a
   suitable mac_bundled_jdk_path.

2. Build the native Mac launcher. You will need the command-line development
   utilities (C compiler) installed.
   
   a. Enter the 'package/macfiles/nativelauncher' directory
   
   b. "export JAVA_HOME=(path to Java home directory)"
      See the compile.sh script for examples.
      
   c. "./compile.sh"

3. From the BlueJ source directory, run "ant mac-dist".
