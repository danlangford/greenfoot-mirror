How to build the BlueJ/Greenfoot launcher (and installer)
---------------------------------------------------------

The launcher is built using the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) environment:

http://www.mingw.org/

Any suitably recent version should do. They don't make it particularly clear what
packages you'll need but in general:

- gcc
- binutils
- GNU make
- MinGW API for Windows
- MinGW runtime
- MSYS base system

... should be a good start (please let me know if I've missed anything). 

If you want to build the Windows installer, you will also need InnoSetup:

(Version 5.2.3 should be fine).


Step 1.
-------

Edit the Makefile and select either a BlueJ or Greenfoot build. For example:

  # For BlueJ
  #APPNAME=\"BlueJ\"
  #GREENFOOTDEF=

  # For Greenfoot
  APPNAME=\"Greenfoot\"
  GREENFOOTDEF=-DGREENFOOT
  
... will build the Greenfoot launcher. If you want the BlueJ launcher, you should
comment out the Greenfoot settings for APPNAME and GREENFOOTDEF, and uncomment the
BlueJ settings.


Step 2.
-------

Edit the bjlaunch.rc file and correct the version numbers. This needs to be done
in two places. Make sure to change the information (protected by #ifdef) for the
correct product, either BlueJ or Greenfoot.

Example settings to look for:

  FILEVERSION 1,5,1,0
  PRODUCTVERSION 1,5,1,0

            VALUE "FileVersion", "1.5.1"
            VALUE "InternalName", "greenfoot"
            VALUE "OriginalFilename", "greenfoot.exe"
            VALUE "ProductName", "Greenfoot"
            VALUE "ProductVersion", "1.5.1"



Step 3.
-------

Run "make".

This should be done from within the bash shell in the MSYS environment.

The generated launcher is always called "bjlaunch.exe" (even for Greenfoot).

IMPORTANT: Before you build the installer in the next step, if you are building
Greenfoot, you should change the launcher name to "gflaunch.exe".


Step 4.
-------

You can now build the Windows installer.

First, run the "ready-to-run" ant task in the build.xml file in the root
of the BlueJ source distribution. The "build.properties" file (in the same location)
will need to be edited first (specify the BlueJ build location and JDK location, etc).

Then run the "windows-dist" ant task in the same build file.

The installer will be generated in the package/winsetup subdirectory.
